# Secure Coding with OWASP Resources

## OWASP Top 10

- Generate awareness of the top vulnerabilities
- The go-to document for web security
- Usually updated every 2-3 years

OWASP API Security Top 10

- Focuses on API vulnerabilities
- APIs are critical to the internet
- Overlaps with the OWASP Top 10
- A course for this on Pluralsight

### OWASP Proactive Controls

- Important security controls 
- Ensure a strong defense

### OWASP Cheat Sheets

- Best practices for developers
- Other documents will Gives you answers
- leave you with questions

### OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)

Security testing guide
- Developers
- Security testers
Create features based on tests

> OWASP ASVS
- Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) v4.03
- Creates a verifiable application security standard
- 3 levels of security

> ASVS Level 1
- “the bare minimum that all applications should strive for”
- Covers easy to find / exploit vulnerabilities
- For typically non-sensitive data

> ASVS Level 2
- Defend against most threats
- Resist skilled / motivated attackers
- Applications with:
  - Significant business functionality
  - Sensitive information

> ASVS Level 3
- Significant security effort
- Critical applications e.g.
  - Military
  - Critical national infrastructre

### Secure Software Development Life Cycle

- Is security embedded in the life cycle? E.g. threat modelling
- Sharing tried and tested security functionality
- Using a secure coding checklist
- Secure appears across the life cycle

### Authentication Architecture
- Used secure patterns?
- Applied authentication consistently
  - Prefer one over many types of authentication
- Is authentication used on backend components?
- Logging and monitoring?
  
### Access Control Architecture
- Who can access what:
  - Data
  - Functionality
- No duplication of access control code
- Are controls enforced at the server?

### Input and Output Architecture
