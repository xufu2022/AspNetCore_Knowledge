Role-based authorization
Claims transformation: keeping the original claim types

## Authorization

> RBAC: 
- Role-based access control
> ABAC: 
- Attribute-based access control (aka CBAC, aka PBAC)

## Summary

- Resetting the claim mapping dictionary ensures the original claim types are kept
- We can manipulate the ClaimsIdentity through ClaimActions to ensure claims are added or removed
- ASP.NET Core has built-in support for role-based authorization
